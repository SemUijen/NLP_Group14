      " Bloomberg     Hon Hai Precision Industry Co   the iPhone assembler that s part of Foxconn Technology Group  plans to establish a joint venture with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to develop and make electric vehicles in China \n",
      "Hon Hai and its subsidiaries will hold a 50  stake in the venture  and Fiat Chrysler will hold the rest  the Taiwanese company said in an exchange filing  While the two companies have yet to sign a formal agreement  they plan to target the China market first and consider exporting cars later \n",
      "The two aim to ink the agreement in the first quarter  according to a person familiar with the matter  and Hon Hai s Hong Kong listed unit FIT Hon Teng will also be involved  A Fiat Chrysler representative didn t immediately comment beyond the filing \n",
      " Hon Hai will be responsible for design  components and supply chain management   Chairman Young Liu told Bloomberg News in a text message  adding that the company will not get into car assembly  The manufacturer expects the automotive business to account for 10  of overall sales in the long run  according to Liu  and the new venture will have little impact on Hon Hai s earnings this year \n",
      "Hon Hai and Fiat Chrysler are focusing on the China market because of sheer volume  Liu said  While consumers in the country buy more electric vehicles than anywhere else in the world  sales have slumped since the government pared back subsidies amid a broader market downturn in demand \n",
      "Hon Hai relies on Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   for about half of sales  Past attempts to diversify its product lines have not been entirely successful  The company tried to invest in a number of electric vehicle ventures before  but none has borne any fruit \n",
      "Sir Jonathan Ive left the building in June this year  and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  shed  9 billion in market cap when the announcement was made  That wasn t surprising  Ive was the Cupertino  California  company s design guru and the man behind some of Apple s most iconic products  So his unexpected departure came as a shock to Apple investors at a time when iPhone sales are on the wane \n",
      "It has been five months since Ive left and it is clear by now that his departure hasn t dented investor confidence one bit  Apple has remained a top growth stock \n",
      "\n",
      "AAPL data by YCharts \n",
      "The iPhone has regained its mojo  and the company looks all set for a big 2020  So it would be relatively safe to say that Ive s departure was probably a blessing in disguise for Apple  Let me explain why \n",
      "Apple needed a change\n",
      "Ive had been at Apple since 1992  so his departure probably gave Apple executives the room to get someone else on board with a fresh perspective  After all  there wasn t much to differentiate recent generation iPhones from their rivals as design innovation in the smartphone space came to a grinding halt \n",
      "Of course  Apple has moved ahead with the times by equipping the iPhones with an all screen design  but that s not different from what others in the industry are doing  Thanks to the premium positioning of Apple s iPhones  consumers were finding it hard to dole out the extra cash when comparing them to cheaper but well equipped rivals \n",
      "For instance  there were several Chinese smartphones similar in appearance to the iPhone X  and at much lower prices  In the meantime  Apple s prime rival Samsung pushed the smartphone design envelope with a foldable device in 2019  and Motorola Mobility followed suit by rebooting the iconic Razr phone in a foldable form \n",
      "What s more  even Huawei has joined the foldable smartphone revolution with the Mate X  Apple  on the other hand  has been slow to catch up to this trend  Cupertino has already filed a patent that indicates it is working on foldable smartphone design  though it might be a couple years before a foldable iPhone hits the market  as recent leaks suggest \n",
      "In all  Apple s rivals are looking more likely to pull ahead of the curve on the design front as far as innovation is concerned  I m saying this because a foldable smartphone could give users more screen real estate that they can use to play games  browse the internet  or consume video content \n",
      "This could be a key selling point for foldable smartphones and prove to be a pain point for Apple  which has been losing a lot of ground in the smartphone space  The bottom line is that while rivals have been trying new things  Apple has gone stagnant  This is why it was important for Cupertino to try something new on the design front  and that required a fresh perspective \n",
      "\n",
      "Small design changes are helping iPhone sales\n",
      "By now  it is clear that Apple needed to shake things up from a product development standpoint  There hasn t been a major shake up just yet in the post Ive era  That s because  even though Ive left to form his own design firm to pursue other things  he continues to work closely with the company on a  range of projects   according to the statement Apple issued at the time of his departure  He s just doing so with a trusted contractor s level of access and oversight \n",
      "It s becoming clear though that the small changes made to this year s iPhone have started bearing fruit and could encourage Apple to move further away from Ive s design philosophy \n",
      "The latest iPhone 11 Pro Max has bulked up instead of slimming down  It weighs 226 grams  up from last year s top of the line iPhone XS Max s 208 grams  The depth of the device has also increased this time  to 8 1 millimeters  while the previous two flagship devices had a depth of 7 7 mm \n",
      "The bulk and the depth of the iPhone 11 Pro Max can be attributed to a bigger battery  along with the addition of a third camera  These practical changes and a lower entry level price have injected new vigor into iPhone sales  This might not have been possible had Ive been at the helm since the design guru was reportedly obsessed with making devices thinner \n",
      "Design leaks indicate that Apple will continue to make tweaks to the iPhone s appearance next year  The company might eliminate the notch at the top of the viewscreen that allows for the earphone and forward facing camera and even go for a complete design overhaul as it prepares to integrate 5G into 2020 iPhones \n",

      "By Stella Qiu and Ryan Woo BEIJING  Reuters    Factory activity in China expanded for a second straight month in April but at a much slower pace than expected  an official survey showed on Tuesday  suggesting the economy is still struggling for traction despite a flurry of support measures  The unexpected loss of momentum at the start of the second quarter followed upbeat data in March which had raised hopes among global investors that the world s second largest economy was getting back on firmer footing  A private business survey on Tuesday also pointed to a loss of momentum  confounding expectations for a pick up  with factories starting to shed jobs again after adding staff in March for the first time in years  The weak manufacturing readings  along with softer construction growth  could stoke debate over how much more stimulus China needs to generate a sustainable recovery  without risking a rapid jump in debt   The official Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI  for manufacturing fell to 50 1 in April from March s reading of 50 5  which was the first expansion in four months  data from the statistics bureau showed  It hovered just above the neutral 50 point mark which separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis  Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the PMI to match March s 50 5   For now  the official PMIs suggest that Q2 got off to a weaker start and reinforce our view that there are still some downside risks to near term activity   Julian Evans Pritchard  senior China economist at Capital Economics  said in a research note  Shares in much of Asia fell after the data  while the Chinese yuan and the Australian dollar wilted  China s slowdown has weighed heavily on exports of many of its trading partners and sales of multinational firms from Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  to industrial conglomerate 3M  NYSE MMM   While the official factory survey disappointed on the growth front  it did not show a marked deterioration in business conditions  either  Output expanded at a slower but still moderate pace  while growth in new orders eased only slightly  Some analysts had expected a pullback in the PMIs  arguing that March s more upbeat readings were likely due in part to one off factors  such as changes in production and purchasing patterns ahead of a cut in value added tax rates on April 1  A spokesperson for the statistics bureau said earlier this month that many firms had brought forward purchases of input materials ahead of the tax change in order to increase their tax deductions  Indeed  a PMI sub index for inventories of raw materials retreated significantly from March s seven month high   A gauge of construction activity fell to 60 1 from 61 7 in March  still solid but possibly indicating that the government s infrastructure push may be losing steam despite a burst of bond issuance and new bank lending at the start of the year  analysts said  To counter the slowdown  Beijing has ramped up fiscal stimulus this year  unveiling tax and fee cuts amounting to 2 trillion yuan   297 billion  to ease burdens on firms  while allowing local governments to issue 2 15 trillion yuan of special bonds to fund infrastructure projects  Analysts have cautioned it will take time for those measures to fully kick in  with most not expecting the economy to convincingly stabilize until around mid year   Another official survey on Tuesday showed growth in China s services industry also cooled in April  though it remained in solid expansionary territory   EYES ON TRADE DEAL While new factory orders remained sluggish  there were some encouraging signs on the export front  The official index for export orders continued to contract  but hit its highest level in eight months  as optimism grows that Beijing and Washington will reach a trade deal in coming weeks which could ease pressure on Chinese exporters  President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he would soon host Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the White House  setting the stage for a possible agreement on trade between the world s two largest economies  U S  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told the New York Times that negotiations are in  the final laps  as he and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer prepared to fly to Beijing for more talks this week  ENCOURAGING SIGNS Despite the disappointing factory readings  analysts say there are signs that earlier growth boosting measures are starting to percolate through the system   The official PMI survey showed small and mid sized manufacturers continued to fare worse than larger companies  many of which are state controlled  But small manufacturers  activity improved to a six month high  suggesting that policymakers  efforts to support the struggling private sector are starting to bear fruit  Big state run banks have been told to increase lending to smaller firms by 30 percent this year  even if it risks more bad loans  and the central bank has been guiding shorter term money market interest rates lower  Profits may already be turning the corner  China s industrial firms reported higher earnings in March after four months of contraction  Better than expected March data had prompted a major shift in the market s expectations for more stimulus this year  with analysts and investors scaling back forecasts for the timing and size of further support measures  After the drop in April s PMIs   Beijing can t afford to stop easing   economists at Nomura said  China s economy grew at a steady 6 4 percent pace in the first quarter  defying expectations for a further slowdown  While analysts believe stimulus will put a floor under growth eventually  they are not predicting a strong rebound as seen in China in the past  noting Beijing s support measures so far have been relatively more restrained  \n",

      "By Jeffrey Dastin SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Millions of users of Amazon s Echo speakers have grown accustomed to the soothing strains of Alexa  the human sounding virtual assistant that can tell them the weather  order takeout and handle other basic tasks in response to a voice command  So a customer was shocked last year when Alexa blurted out   Kill your foster parents   Alexa has also chatted with users about sex acts  She gave a discourse on dog defecation  And this summer  a hack Amazon traced back to China may have exposed some customers  data  according to five people familiar with the events  Alexa is not having a breakdown  The episodes  previously unreported  arise from Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  Inc s strategy to make Alexa a better communicator  New research is helping Alexa mimic human banter and talk about almost anything she finds on the internet  However  ensuring she does not offend users has been a challenge for the world s largest online retailer  At stake is a fast growing market for gadgets with virtual assistants  An estimated two thirds of U S  smart speaker customers  about 43 million people  use Amazon s Echo devices  according to research firm eMarketer  It is a lead the company wants to maintain over the Google Home from Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc and the HomePod from Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL    For a graphic on Amazon s lead in smart speakers  click    Over time  Amazon wants to get better at handling complex customer needs through Alexa  be they home security  shopping or companionship   Many of our AI dreams are inspired by science fiction   said Rohit Prasad  Amazon s vice president and head scientist of Alexa Artificial Intelligence  AI   during a talk last month in Las Vegas  To make that happen  the company in 2016 launched the annual Alexa Prize  enlisting computer science students to improve the assistant s conversation skills  Teams vie for the  500 000 first prize by creating talking computer systems known as chatbots that allow Alexa to attempt more sophisticated discussions with people  Amazon customers can participate by saying  let s chat  to their devices  Alexa then tells users that one of the bots will take over  unshackling the voice aide s normal constraints  From August to November alone  three bots that made it to this year s finals had 1 7 million conversations  Amazon said  The project has been important to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos  who signed off on using the company s customers as guinea pigs  one of the people said  Amazon has been willing to accept the risk of public blunders to stress test the technology in real life and move Alexa faster up the learning curve  the person said  The experiment is already bearing fruit  The university teams are helping Alexa have a wider range of conversations  Amazon customers have also given the bots better ratings this year than last  the company said  But Alexa s gaffes are alienating others  and Bezos on occasion has ordered staff to shut down a bot  three people familiar with the matter said  The user who was told to whack his foster parents wrote a harsh review on Amazon s website  calling the situation  a whole new level of creepy   A probe into the incident found the bot had quoted a post without context from Reddit  the social news aggregation site  according to the people  The privacy implications may be even messier  Consumers might not realize that some of their most sensitive conversations are being recorded by Amazon s devices  information that could be highly prized by criminals  law enforcement  marketers and others  On Thursday  Amazon said a  human error  let an Alexa customer in Germany access another user s voice recordings accidentally   The potential uses for the Amazon datasets are off the charts   said Marc Groman  an expert on privacy and technology policy who teaches at Georgetown Law   How are they going to ensure that  as they share their data  it is being used responsibly  and will not lead to a  data driven catastrophe  like the recent woes at Facebook  In July  Amazon discovered one of the student designed bots had been hit by a hacker in China  people familiar with the incident said  This compromised a digital key that could have unlocked transcripts of the bot s conversations  stripped of users  names  Amazon quickly disabled the bot and made the students rebuild it for extra security  It was unclear what entity in China was responsible  according to the people  The company acknowledged the event in a statement   At no time were any internal Amazon systems or customer identifiable data impacted   it said  Amazon declined to discuss specific Alexa blunders reported by Reuters  but stressed its ongoing work to protect customers from offensive content   These instances are quite rare especially given the fact that millions of customers have interacted with the socialbots   Amazon said  Like Google s search engine  Alexa has the potential to become a dominant gateway to the internet  so the company is pressing ahead   By controlling that gateway  you can build a super profitable business   said Kartik Hosanagar  a Wharton professor studying the digital economy  PANDORA S BOX Amazon s business strategy for Alexa has meant tackling a massive research problem  How do you teach the art of conversation to a computer  Alexa relies on machine learning  the most popular form of AI  to work  These computer programs transcribe human speech and then respond to that input with an educated guess based on what they have observed before  Alexa  learns  from new interactions  gradually improving over time  In this way  Alexa can execute simple orders   Play the Rolling Stones   And she knows which script to use for popular questions such as   What is the meaning of life   Human editors at Amazon pen many of the answers  That is where Amazon is now  The Alexa Prize chatbots are forging the path to where Amazon aims to be  with an assistant capable of natural  open ended dialogue  That requires Alexa to understand a broader set of verbal cues from customers  a task that is challenging even for humans  This year s Alexa Prize winner  a 12 person team from the University of California  Davis  used more than 300 000 movie quotes to train computer models to recognize distinct sentences  Next  their bot determined which ones merited responses  categorizing social cues far more granularly than technology Amazon shared with contestants  For instance  the UC Davis bot recognizes the difference between a user expressing admiration   that s cool   and a user expressing gratitude   thank you    The next challenge for social bots is figuring out how to respond appropriately to their human chat buddies  For the most part  teams programmed their bots to search the internet for material  They could retrieve news articles found in The Washington Post  the newspaper that Bezos privately owns  through a licensing deal that gave them access  They could pull facts from Wikipedia  a film database or the book recommendation site Goodreads  Or they could find a popular post on social media that seemed relevant to what a user last said  That opened a Pandora s box for Amazon  During last year s contest  a team from Scotland s Heriot Watt University found that its Alexa bot developed a nasty personality when they trained her to chat using comments from Reddit  whose members are known for their trolling and abuse  The team put guardrails in place so the bot would steer clear of risky subjects  But that did not stop Alexa from reciting the Wikipedia entry for masturbation to a customer  Heriot Watt s team leader said  One bot described sexual intercourse using words such as  deeper   which on its own is not offensive  but was vulgar in this particular context   I don t know how you can catch that through machine learning models  That s almost impossible   said a person familiar with the incident   Amazon has responded with tools the teams can use to filter profanity and sensitive topics  which can spot even subtle offenses  The company also scans transcripts of conversations and shuts down transgressive bots until they are fixed  But Amazon cannot anticipate every potential problem because sensitivities change over time  Amazon s Prasad said in an interview  That means Alexa could find new ways to shock her human listeners  \n",

      "By Dominique Patton and Tom Polansek BEIJING CHICAGO  Reuters    U S  producers of pork  already saddled with duties enacted in an earlier round of the escalating trade dispute with China  are bracing for further pain after Beijing hit the products with additional tariffs due to come into effect next month  China implemented a 25 percent duty on most U S  pork items on April 2  and a 15 percent tariff on a range of fruits and nuts  in response to U S  tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum products  Last week it included both categories in a second round of tariffs to be imposed on July 6  No other products have been listed twice  Pork now faces cumulative import duties of 71 percent  not including value added tax  according to a formula published on the website of China s finance ministry last week  Cumulative duties on fruit amount to 50 percent    The additional tariff will put us out of business   said Zhong Zheng  founder of China based Heartland Brothers  which sells U S  produced Berkshire pork to Chinese supermarkets and restaurants  The United States shipped  489 million worth of pork to China last year  and had the biggest share of import volumes in the first quarter of 2018  at about 117 000 tonnes  according to Chinese customs  But shipments have since ground to a near halt following the 25 percent tariffs implemented in April  said U S  meat analyst Brett Stuart  president of Global AgriTrends   They ve pretty much stopped our pork   he said  Total duties on U S  pork will reach 88 percent from next month  after factoring in the 10 percent value added tax  according to one industry expert s calculation  That comes as margins at some of the biggest U S  pork processors reach their lowest level in three years  dragged down by surging hog prices and mounting worries over trade with China and Mexico  With the new duties on U S  pork  Chinese buyers will turn to other suppliers in Europe and Brazil  said Pan Chenjun  senior analyst at Rabobank  UNCERTAINTY AND CONFUSION Compounding the pain  most in the industry were still unsure about how to calculate the new tariffs  leaving them unprepared for the impact   We re trying to get confirmation of how the duties will be implemented and we have not been able to   said Joe Schuele  spokesman at the U S  Meat Export Federation on Wednesday  The industry association represents firms like  Tyson Foods  Inc  N TSN   JBS USA  JBS UL  and WH Group Ltd s  HK 0288  Smithfield Foods  Smithfield and Tyson declined to comment  JBS did not immediately respond to a request for comment  The North American Meat Institute  an industry group that represents  Hormel Foods Corp   N HRL  and others  is also still waiting to learn the size of the tariff from the American embassy in Beijing or trade officials  said a spokeswoman  Uncertainty about the size of the tariff makes it harder for meat packers to plan how much pork to process  said Bill Westman  senior vice president of international affairs for the institute   When you re planning your production process  you need some lead time and you need some certainty in the market to do it   he said   That s why there s some hesitation here  Do we produce for the Chinese market when the tariffs may go up significantly July 6   Mark Powers  president of the Northwest Horticultural Council  who handles trade issues for apples  pears and cherries from farms in Washington  Oregon and Idaho  is also seeking confirmation from the U S  government about how the tariffs will be applied  Chinese customers had informed him on Wednesday that the latest tariff would replace the earlier one  he added  A Shanghai based produce company manager  who declined to be identified  said he believed the new tariffs would not be compounded on existing tariffs  and their inclusion on the latest list was a bureaucratic  oversight   However  he added that  the document itself is a bit vague so we can t rule out this possibility  if the trade situation further deteriorates   Imposition of both duties would cause Chinese purchases to fall sharply  he said  and air freighted cargoes of cherries currently on their way to China would be canceled  China is the third largest export market for U S  fresh cherries  according to the U S  Department of Agriculture  U S  exporters shipped  119 million of fresh cherries to China  just under a third of total shipments worth  605 million in 2017  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and pear shipments would be even harder hit when the season starts this autumn as they face more competition from other markets  said Powers  \n",

      "By Yawen Chen and Se Young Lee BEIJING  Reuters    China s commerce ministry on Thursday accused the United States of being  capricious  over bilateral trade issues  and warned that the interests of U S  workers and farmers ultimately will be hurt by Washington s penchant for brandishing  big sticks   Previous trade negotiations with the United States were constructive  but Beijing has had to respond in a strong manner due to the U S  tariff threats  commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng said  President Donald Trump threatened on Monday to hit  200 billion of Chinese imports with 10 percent tariffs if Beijing retaliates against his previous announcement to target  50 billion in imports  The United States has accused China of stealing U S  intellectual property  a charge Beijing denies  Washington s accusations of forced tech transfers are a distortion of reality  and China is fully prepared to respond with  quantitative  and  qualitative  tools if the U S  releases a new list of tariffs  Gao told a regular briefing in Beijing   China could hit back at U S  firms listed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average if Trump keeps heightening tension with Beijing over trade  state controlled Chinese tabloid the Global Times said on Thursday  The 30 stock Dow  which counts Boeing  NYSE BA  Co  Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  and  Nike  Inc  NYSE NKE  among its constituents  fell 0 17 percent on Wednesday and has declined 0 25 percent this year  By contrast  China s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has slumped 13 1 percent year to date    It is deeply regrettable that the U S  has been capricious  escalated the tensions  and provoked a trade war   Gao said   The U S  is accustomed to holding  big sticks  for negotiations  but this approach does not apply to China    White House trade adviser Peter Navarro  who views China as a hostile economic and military power  said on Tuesday Trump s actions were a necessary defense of the  crown jewels  in the U S  economy  None of the U S  administration s efforts to negotiate with Beijing had yielded progress on changing China s  predatory  trade practices  Navarro said  Fending off criticism from some Western countries  China has said it is willing to boost imports and widen market access  In April  President Xi Jinping told a high profile Chinese forum that import tariffs would be cut on goods such as cars  among other promises  In May  Beijing said it would lower import tariffs on 1 449 consumer goods  starting from July 1    I ve been honoring my words with actions   Xi told a group of foreign chief executives in Beijing on Thursday   OPEN TRADE CONFLICT Xi said countries should not fight among themselves  but instead cooperate and meet challenges together  adding that the last global financial crisis happened not too long ago    We still have vivid memories of what happened during the financial crisis and we are not yet fully recovered   he said   We must also stay vigilant because  as economic growth still lacks momentum  we have seen a surge of trade protectionism  isolationism and populism   Global financial markets have shuddered this week amid worries about open trade conflict between the world s two biggest economies   Three rounds of high level talks since early May failed to reach a compromise on U S  complaints over Chinese practices and its record deficit with China   Last year  the deficit was about  375 billion  as China imported  129 89 billion of U S  goods  while the United States purchased  505 47 billion of Chinese products  according to U S  data  A Sino U S  trade war could disrupt global supply chains for the tech and auto industries  sectors heavily reliant on outsourced components  and derail world growth   U S  unilateral protection measures will ultimately harm the interests of U S  companies  workers and farmers   Gao told reporters   British forecaster Oxford Economics  in a recent note  said it  will not be easy for the U S  to identify  200 billion worth of Chinese imports that it can levy tariffs on without hurting U S  companies and or consumers  given the strong involvement of U S  companies in a large share of China s exports to the U S    Gao said China and the U S  were due to negotiate on issues around the manufacturing and service industries in the near future   Chinese shares fell on Thursday on investor worries about the trade dispute  with the Shanghai index languishing at a two year low and stocks of about 100 firms down by the daily limit of 10 percent    I suspect that the U S  indices will start to sniff out the specific losers from this trade war  and individual stocks will get hurt much more than the broad index as investors understand this isn t going to kill global growth   Andrew Polk  co founder of research firm Trivium China  told the Reuters Global Markets Forum    But it will impact some companies disproportionately    EVEN MORE TARIFFS China said it would impose additional tariffs on 659 U S  goods  with duties on 545 to kick in on July 6  after Trump said Washington would levy tariffs on  50 billion of Chinese products   Beijing s planned tariffs would add to duties it had already slapped on 128 U S  goods  such as pork  fruits and nuts  in reaction to Trump s earlier move to impose taxes on Chinese steel and aluminum  The U S  goods affected on July 6 also include pork and fruit  as well as soybeans  autos and an array of marine products  A trade war would hit U S  farmers  a vast majority of whom supported Trump in the 2016 election   Jobs for the Chinese are just as precious as those for the Americans   Zha Daojiong  a professor of international political economy at Peking University  told Reuters in an email   It will be wise for the two sides to come back to the negotiation table  abide by a temporary agreement and turn down the rhetoric   Beijing has yet to set a tariff activation date for the remaining 114 U S  products  which include crude oil  coal and a host of refined fuel products    We cannot be soft with Trump  He is using his  irrationality  as a tactic and he is trying to confuse us   said Chen Fengying  an economics expert at state backed China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations  \n",

      "By Leigh Thomas PARIS  Reuters    French President Emmanuel Macron swept into office last May on a pledge to create jobs and improve the lives of workers by rebooting the country s economy  A year on  annual economic growth has picked up    closing the gap with Germany and pulling away from other major European powers such as Britain and Italy  The pace of new business openings have increased sharply and improvements in the jobs market have left some employers warning about skilled workers being in short supply  But economists say the rosier picture is due at least in part to stronger growth across Europe as well as policies put in place by Macron s predecessor  Francois Hollande   To help measure Macron s impact on the economy  Reuters has compiled a graphic showing a dashboard of indicators that will update as new data is released over the course of his presidency   Graphic  Track Macron s impact on the economy     The data show some early signs that the president s policies are having an effect among entrepreneurs and in the labor market  But there has been little change in disposable income for workers and efforts to reverse years of declining competitiveness don t appear to have borne fruit  Macron s ability to re invigorate the euro zone s second largest economy will be a critical factor in how his success is measured at home  It will also shape how much influence he can bring to bear in Europe  where he is trying to convince Germany of the need to further overhaul economic and monetary union to bolster the euro zone against future crises  While the economy grew quickly after Macron s election  it slowed at the start of this year due in part due to one off factors that curtailed consumer spending  according to figures released Friday  Economists said they expect growth to return to a healthy clip  Macron has repeatedly said his reforms would start to have a significant impact 18 months to two years into his presidency  An Elysee adviser told Reuters there was no time frame for improving the economic outlook   That s why we re not cheering about the current upturn  because we re perfectly aware that to a large extent it s down to the economic context   FALLING UNEMPLOYMENT When Macron took office in May  the French economy was starting to rebound after years of unimpressive growth  That gave him a firm footing on which to confront France s historically muscular trade unions as he seeks to reshape economic and social policy  A former investment banker  Macron had been a minister in the Hollande s government  before quitting to launch his own political movement  Barely a year later  aged 39 years  he led it to electoral victory casting himself as an agent of change  of  neither of the left nor the right    Macron quickly moved to start overhauling France s labor regulations to tackle unemployment  which was well above the eurozone average  Macron s government has provided employers more freedom to hire and fire through a loosening of labor rules  among other measures  Initial signs appear promising for Macron  Overall unemployment in France is down to 8 9 percent  from 9 4 percent when he took office and below the 9 1 percent average for the country over the last 20 years  according to France s INSEE statistics agency  Youth unemployment is falling at an even faster pace  Companies also are more frequently hiring on permanent contracts as opposed to short term ones  The level approached 49 percent in February  a level only rarely seen over the past two decades  according to Reuters analysis of data from the ACOSS national payrolls agency   However  economists say the increase in permanent contracts appears only partly due to Macron s policies as numbers were rising before he assumed office  A shortage of skilled labor is also helping workers negotiate more favorable terms   START UP NATION  The most marked difference is in the rate at which new businesses are starting up  Macron had made a high profile push to encourage entrepreneurship  promising within weeks of his election to transform France into a  nation of start ups   In its first budget  Macron s government scrapped a wealth tax long opposed by entrepreneurs and set a flat 30 percent tax for all capital income  The number of new businesses opening spiked in the immediate aftermath of Macron s election as president and the rate has continued to grow at a double digit pace  The business community say Macron s arrival has brought about a dramatic change in attitude to entrepreneurship in a country where people traditionally have been reluctant to take the risk of starting new businesses  Landing a job at a bank or a household brand is no longer the sole badge of success for graduates of top business schools  such as HEC  said Olivier Millet  the head of venture capital lobby France Invest       There s a political message when HEC students are not going into finance or marketing but into entrepreneurship   he said   You haven t succeeded in life unless you ve started a company   The reforms have prompted some political opponents to dub him  president of the rich   an idea he dismisses saying he has no problem with wealth as long as it benefits the broader economy  PURCHASING POWER Another key factor for voters and the economy is whether French workers notice any improvement in their wallets  So far  households have seen little increase in disposable income  according to INSEE  the statistics agency  And  what increase there has been in wage growth has largely been offset by higher inflation  leaving gross disposable income growth stagnant since Macron took office  Macron has introduced some tax cuts  such as reductions to workers payroll tax  but they are being phased in over time to ease the impact on public finances   A lot of workers say the economy is growing again  but there s no reduction in inequality  so there s a huge demand for better distribution   said veteran union boss Jean Claude Mailly  who retired last month as head of the Force Ouvriere  People are  getting impatient   he told Reuters  Macron s government estimates its tax reforms will add 1 6 percent to gross domestic product by 2025 and create a quarter of a million jobs  FOREIGN INVESTMENT France has also seen a significant increase in foreign direct investment  which reached a decade high last year  according to the central bank  What we saw in 2017 is not so much linked to the election and change of government as the result of the previous two  three  four years   said Pascal Cagni  the former Europe head of Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and now chairman of Business France  which promotes the country among foreign businesses  But Cagni said he believes Macron s policies will encourage foreign investment to continue to grow   That s why I am extremely positive about the outlook   The competitiveness of French firms overseas  however  has not improved  French exporters are still struggling

      "By David Lawder and Howard Schneider WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  consumers may be about to directly feel the effects of the trade fight started by U S  President Trump with China and other countries this year when a new list of Chinese imports to be taxed is announced in coming days   After imposing import tariffs on solar panels and washing machines in January  Trump moved to levy steel and aluminum in March along with about  50 billion in other goods  After China responded with a list of U S  goods that would be subject to tariffs  Trump raised the stakes on April 4 by directing the U S  Trade Representative to consider  100 billion in additional levies  But a Reuters analysis of Chinese imports shows that to quickly reach  100 billion worth of goods to tax  Trump may have to target cellphones  computers  toys  clothing  footwear  furniture and other consumer goods  prompting price rises at U S  retailers   There is no way to avoid consumer products when you re thinking about how to hit  100 billion worth of imports coming from China   said Hun Quach  vice president of international trade for the Retail Industry Leaders Association which represents U S  retailers  How much the news tariffs would hit wallets depends on variables that make calculating the impact of the tariffs on individual products hard to measure  Companies can absorb some of the costs  and some companies can shift production in China to other countries  cutting the final bill for America s shoppers  After washing machines imported by LG Electronics   KS 066570  were hit with a 20 percent tariff in January  the company raised U S  prices by about  50 per machine  or 4 percent to 8 percent  LG opted to absorb part of the tariff cost  which was imposed at a time when construction was already well underway on its new U S  factory that will begin producing washers in late 2018  avoiding U S  tariffs  Companies with complex supply chains  mainly those in high technology industries  can also change how their internal costs are charged among subsidiaries to lower their tariff bill  Trump s first round of import tariffs deliberately left most consumer electronics untouched  but out of the  506 billion in U S  imports from China last year  finding another  100 billion to tax without hurting U S  shoppers will not be easy  The USTR could quickly find  100 billion but at the cost of targeting three broad categories of consumer electronics   cellphones at  44 billion  computer equipment at  37 billion  and voice  image and data recorders at  22 billion   U S  supply chains would also be hurt as many consumer electronics products depend on the export of American semiconductors  software and other inputs to China for assembly before being imported back to the United States   U S  allies South Korea  Japan and Taiwan also supply cellphone parts for companies like Apple Inc  O AAPL   including displays  cameras and fingerprint scanners  and would feel the impact   You end up shooting yourself in the foot  shooting your allies in the foot  and maybe you wound China s big toe   said Chad Bown  a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics  ORDERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN PLACED Trump could get a quarter of the way to  100 billion in goods taxed by levying toys  games and sporting goods  categories with little U S  content that totaled about  25 5 billion from China in 2017   But China made up 81 5 percent of all U S  imports in this group  meaning that there would be few alternative sources for importers that could blunt the tariff impact on consumers  Adding in apparel  footwear and furniture to the list would get the rest of the way to  100 billion  but price rises for those categories of goods would be seen clearly by consumers  According to Census data  there are about 7 600 consumer and industrial goods still available for tariffs with a combined value of  101 billion where China accounts for 40 percent or less of U S  imports and so could possibly be sourced elsewhere   Most of these involve small scale production and a wide range of goods sold in U S  chain stores such as Wal Mart  N WMT   including clothing  pet food and lighting fixtures  While the availability of these items in other countries could help limit price rises  there would still be disruptions for retailers with long established supply chains   Sourcing from another country is not an easy solution  It can t happen overnight   said RILA s Quach  who added that retailers  Christmas orders for 2018 are already locked in  And there are few alternatives for the  402 million in Christmas tree lights that China supplies   Economists earlier surveyed by Reuters warned that  while imposing tariffs may benefit U S  steel and aluminum producers  costs would rise for many other U S  producers and consumers as a result  U S  exporters will also feel the impact of the trade war after China responded in March by announcing tariffs on 128 products such as fruit and wine which the U S exports to China and which will taxed at 15 percent  Another  50 billion worth of U S  exports such as automobiles  airplanes  pork and soybean face a 25 percent tariff  During the 2016 election campaign Trump argued that tariffs were needed to punish China for misappropriating U S  technology and to bring jobs and industry back to the U S   but studies of the 2002 steel tariffs enacted by the Bush administration show that they caused more job losses than job gains  \n",

      "Kellogg Company   NYSE K   is slated to come out with fourth quarter 2018 results on Feb 7  This provider of ready to eat cereals and convenience foods  among others  has a mixed record of earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters  Let s see how the company is positioned ahead of the upcoming quarterly results Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise   What to Expect The Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days at 88 cents  which reflects a decline of 8 3  from the year ago quarter s figure  Nonetheless  the consensus mark for revenues is  3 335 million  depicting a rise of 3 9  from revenues recorded in the year ago quarter Factors That Pose WorriesKellogg s U S  snacks business has been struggling since 2013 due to weak volumes  Though Pringles has been performing well  the deterioration is resulting from weakness in weight management products like Special K bars  Special K cracker chips and Right Bites  100 calorie cookie packs due to the same issues that hurt sales of weight management cereal brands  The wholesome snacks business has mostly remained weak over the past few quarters due to effects of certain prior innovations that underperformed  Though management is working to revive the business through investments in innovation and better in store execution  the efforts are yet to bear fruit  In 2017  the segment s net sales dropped 4 1  year over year  Moreover  in the third quarter of 2018  sales in the segment fell 8 6   owing to list price adjustment and rationalization of SKUs  In fact  challenges in Snacks and Morning Foods businesses along with list price adjustments dented organic revenues in the North American business Talking of the company s Morning Foods business  Kellogg s mainstay U S  cereal business  which accounts for a major portion of sales  has been performing poorly since 2012 due to sluggish category growth  Lower demand for cereals due to competitive pressures from other breakfast alternatives  including yogurt  eggs  bread and peanut butter  has been hurting category growth  This is a major concern for sales in the U S  Morning Foods segment  which fell 1 3  during the third quarter of 2018  primarily due to the recall of Honey Smacks Further  Operating profit in the segment declined in the third quarter  owing to lower sales  and higher investments and costs related to new pack formats Unfortunately  management expects higher investments  mix shifts and costs related to expansion of co packed pack formats to dent fourth quarter operating profit  Well  escalated costs are posing hurdles for many food companies like Pilgrim s Pride   NASDAQ PPC    TreeHouse Foods   NYSE THS   and Campbell Soup   NYSE CPB    among others  Coming back to Kellogg  the company trimmed adjusted earnings growth view to 7 8   at cc  from 11 13  projected earlier  These factors raise concerns about the impending quarter Will Buyouts   Cost Saving Efforts Aid the Stock Nevertheless  Kellogg is committed toward enhancing business through innovation  buyouts and cost saving efforts  Notably  Kellogg acquired protein bar maker  Chicago Bar Company in 2017 to diversify its organic offerings  Chicago Bar Company makes RXBAR  which is considered the fastest growing nutrition bar brand in the United States  Further  the company has been gaining from the consolidation of Multipro  a Nigerian food distributor  Markedly  we note that during the second and third quarters of 2018  Kellogg s revenue growth was primarily driven by the takeover of RXBAR and consolidation of Multipro  We expect these businesses to continue driving performance and positively impact Kellogg s top line in the quarter to be reported Additionally  the company should get some cushion from its productivity saving initiatives  Kellogg is particularly striving to reduce overhead costs pertaining to Direct Store Delivery in U S  Snacks  Further  savings from the four year Project K restructuring program are being invested in brand building initiatives  in store execution  sales capabilities and innovation to stabilize sales  Gains from such initiatives are also aiding the company to mitigate cost pressures mainly stemming from transportation  Further  the company started an aggressive zero based budgeting  ZBB  program in 2015 in its North American business to generate savings in addition to that from Project K  We expect these factors to provide some respite to Kellogg in the quarter to be reported What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn t show that Kellogg is likely to beat bottom line estimates this quarter  For this to happen  a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   You can uncover the best

      "In addition to Google  Apple competes in services with another giant  Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   which is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on movies and music  Apple s streaming music service was initially a disaster  In all fairness  it has improved  but today it is fighting an uphill battle because Apple s walled garden approach doesn t allow Apple Music to work on Amazon s and Google s speakers  This gave plenty of breathing room for competitors  who otherwise would not have had a chance \n",
      "Then there is Siri  In the beginning it was the smartest digital voice assistant  but not anymore  Not to be disrespectful to Siri  but its IQ has been dropping rapidly in comparison to Amazon s and Google s assistants  Google and Amazon opened the APIs  application programming interfaces  of their digital voice assistants to other developers  and soon every appliance in your house will be responding to  Hey Google  and  Alexa  \n",
      "There are several reasons why Apple has done so poorly in services  First  it s a product company  Macs  iPhones  and iPads are incredibly complex devices that  though they are packed with software  are released every year or every few years  Services are software   they almost require gradual  even daily improvement  You release an imperfect product and then keep improving it with continual releases  This approach seems to go against Apple s DNA \n",
      "The second and even more important point is that Apple is facing innovator s dilemma  Today two thirds of Apple revenues come from the iPhone  and for that beast to survive it requires a walled garden  This is why Apple s music doesn t work on Amazon s or Google s speakers  Oh  and what about Apple s speakers  Apple predictably took a  premium  strategy with its speakers  a strategy that worked great with Macs  iPhones and iPads  However  the strategy has failed in the case of speakers because Apple s product is several times more expensive than the  good enough  offerings from Google and Amazon  Moreover  the walled garden strategy has backfired here  For instance  Apple speakers will not play Spotify  an incredibly popular music service with 75 million paying users and 150 million active users that competes with Apple s Music  Thus  to protect its iPhone cash cow  Apple services is fighting with one arm tied behind its back \n",
      "As shareholders  we became concerned about future sales of the iPhone and not highly confident that Apple s service strategy will bear fruit  and herein lies the biggest problem for Apple  It needs a new huge product category   The Apple Watch was a mildly successful product  but in the context of  265 billion of sales  it was a rounding error   A car was supposed to be that category   it s the largest product category globally   but  according to the New York Times  Apple has changed its car strategy several times and has basically given up on that category \n",
      "When Apple stock was lower  we did not have to worry as much about slower growth  but now we do   so we got out \n",

      "By Alastair Sharp TORONTO  Reuters    Software maker BlackBerry Ltd s  TO BB   O BBRY  long running recovery effort has been slowed by a dearth of salespeople to promote its revamped and more complex products  with CEO John Chen pledging to hire more sales specialists to help achieve its growth target  While BlackBerry s traditional customers were security executives in top global companies  its reboot from smartphone maker to seller of everything from automotive software to cyber security consulting and asset tracking for the trucking industry has seemingly moved faster than its sales force can keep up  BlackBerry s revenue started declining in 2013 after Apple Inc  O AAPL  and Alphabet Inc  O GOOGL  wrested control of the smartphone market from the Canadian company  Chen took over as chief executive to fashion a turnaround and has been adding new software businesses to boost revenue  which remains a fraction of what it was in its heyday  Chen told analysts on Friday he planned to hire more salespeople for industrial software maker QNX  acquired in 2010  as well as for its Internet of Things business  which connects computing devices in everyday objects and includes the Radar asset tracking service for trucking  Our issue is get it out there and get the deal done   he said   And so we really need to ramp up our distribution channels   A sales force boost will likely eat into profit  at least in the short term  as the metrics of success BlackBerry wants to achieve typically depend on higher commissions to motivate sales staff   Salespeople are coin operated   said Berkeley Warburton  managing director of advanced customer strategy at Accenture   If you want the right behaviors out of them you have to incentivize them in the right way   BlackBerry  which ended February with just over 4 000 employees compared with more than 4 500 a year earlier  declined to say how many of them were involved in sales  Five years ago the company had 16 500 employees  with 1 500 working in sales and marketing  BlackBerry on Friday disappointed investors with an unexpected software sales decline  pushing its shares down as much as 13 percent after a sharp rally in recent months  BlackBerry s quarterly revenue miss prompted caution about Chen s efforts to revive growth   It s really different  in terms of who makes decisions about those things  it s no longer the IT  information technology  team  It s now the product design team   said Eric Johnson  the dean of Vanderbilt University s Owen School of Management  Coupled with that  many of the products and services it is now pitching are much more complicated than selling smartphones   The product doesn t sell itself in the way that they used to  They have more complex products   so BlackBerry s salespeople need to shift focus and sell solutions instead  Accenture s Warburton said  For example  BlackBerry s QNX unit must integrate its automotive software with that of many other vendors as well as the carmaker on a production timeline of years rather than months    It s a highly consultative sales process   Vanderbilt s Johnson said   They re going to have to make significant investments in their sales force to make it work    BlackBerry reached a deal to work directly with  Ford Motor Co   N F  last year  but Chen told reporters in a briefing on Friday that talks with other automakers were taking a long time to bear fruit    The reason is they are going to have to adopt most of our technology for it to make sense   Chen said   This is not a technology issue      The contractual terms and requirements are the long goal   \n",
      "Chen also said he might buy companies to boost sales  with a focus on growth areas including cyber security  machine learning and artificial intelligence  connected cars  and in asset tracking to compliment its Radar product \n",
      "By James Saft  Reuters     James Saft is a Reuters columnist  The opinions expressed are his own  Investors would be better off sticking with firms which pay their chief executives less  according to a new study  Excluding the top 17 outliers  like Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   an investor who put money between 2006 and 2015 in the lowest quintile by CEO pay would have beat those who held those firms in the top quintile by 39 percent in total return terms  according to data from index and analysis firm MSCI  This puts into sharper relief one of the chief mysteries of shareholder capitalism  why long term investors like pension funds fail to hold the companies they own accountable for the massive expansion of executive pay   Even after adjusting for company size and sector  companies with lower total summary CEO pay levels more consistently displayed higher long term investment returns   Ric Marshall and Linda Eling Lee of MSCI wrote in the October report   Long term institutional investors typically bear the cost of this misalignment  yet they have routinely approved CEO pay packages  Closer scrutiny of the relationship between CEO pay and performance over longer time periods could lead to different conclusions      Looking at 429 large capitalization U S  companies which cumulatively paid out almost  46 billion to CEO s over the period  the study found that 10 year returns to the lowest quintile of CEO pay were  367 for every  100 invested  against just  264 for those in the highest fifth  Executives at the largest capitalization firms in the U S  made an average of  15 5 million in compensation in 2015  according to data from the Economic Policy Institute  EPI   276 times the pay of the average employee  Average CEO pay has increased more than ninefold since 1978  outpacing the stock market s advance by 73 percent  And while CEO pay fell by 3 2 percent last year  according to the EPI  that was driven not by lower awards but a stock market driven decline in the value of options granted  It is this levering of pay to the stock market which has been in part behind the huge expansion in executive pay over the past generation  a trend which itself is the poison fruit of a bad idea  the efficient market hypothesis  EFFICIENT MARKETS  In assuming that the market is the best judge of value  pay consultants linked compensation to shares  but did it by granting options  While the value of options is tied to the stock market  it is for executives a one way bet  if shares go up the CEO wins  if they fall she does not lose  This has also gone hand in hand with both shorter tenures among CEOs and arguably a more short term focus  points argued by James Montier of GMO in 2014     This in turn has very likely been a factor in the dearth of capital investment by firms  Why make an investment with an excellent 10 year payoff if you will only be in office for six years  Why indeed if your stock option horizon is only five years  A comprehensive 2009 study by Michael Cooper of the University of Utah  Huseyin Gulen of Purdue and Raghavendra Rau of Cambridge University found CEO pay is actually negatively related to future shareholder gains for periods of up to five years  Companies whose CEO pay is in the top 10 percent actually underperform peers by about 13 percent over five years  according to the study  Outside of executives  boards and the pay consultants who advise them  very few people seem happy with this state of affairs  A recent survey of UK pension funds found that 87 percent believe executives at UK listed companies are paid too much  And this is in the UK  where CEO pay is about half what it is in the U S  In the studies on executive pay there are  broadly  two theories on why higher paying companies underperform  The first is that investors see high pay as a signal of high performance and drive up the price of equity to a level where subsequent returns are disappointing  This seems  at last to me  highly unlikely  The second is that higher pay is a sign of agency problems  the abusive use of company treasure for personal gain by insiders  This is where I d put my money  With many studies expecting lower than usual overall returns over the coming decade  perhaps only 5 or 6 percent a year for a typical balanced portfolio  investors have good reason to push hard on pay  Perhaps they should start by voting with their feet  going long less generous companies and short the ones which hand out big pay packets \n",

      "By Olivia Oran  Reuters    Wall Street banks are piling into equities trading and doing increasingly creative things to win over clients  But as competition heats up  the low margin business may come under further pressure  The list of banks focused on growing equities spans both sides of the Atlantic  including  Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C   UBS Group AG and  Deutsche Bank  AG  DE DBKGn   They are taking different tacks  with some focused purely on old fashioned buying and selling of stocks  others on derivatives or exchange traded funds  and others on prime brokerage or electronic trading  Some aim to do all things for all clients  As newcomers try to gain ground  leading firms like  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS  and  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  are fighting to maintain market share  The business already has razor thin margins  and rivals are trying to nab clients with aggressive prices or new products  traders and analysts said   If everyone tries to grow equities  the economics aren t going to be that great   said Guy Moszkowski  a bank analyst with Autonomous Research   It s also not going to be easy   The industry has set its sights on the business because it is a safe harbor under new capital rules and because client demand is fairly strong  However  launching and growing this kind of business requires big up front investments that can take years to recoup  It is impossible to tell whether banks are building equities trading profitably because they only report revenue from the business  not earnings  A veteran Wall Street executive said it would take a small player at least five years to reach No  5 or 6 in market share  The person  who was not authorized to speak publicly  said it takes that long to recruit talent  build trading technology and attract investors with smart research and useful products  Banks are trying to do just that  Goldman  Morgan Stanley and UBS have created non traditional research teams that use tools like web scraping technology  consumer surveys  social media  climate data  droids and satellite imagery to provide unique analysis  Such analysts might  for example  try to extract inventory data from online retailers to gauge demand for Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Inc s latest product  Banks hope such research will convince clients to route more trading through them  HUNT FOR GROWTH The equities focus is part of a desperate hunt for growth across Wall Street  After five plus years of weak results  banks are lifting every rock to find revenue underneath  First quarter results underscored that trend  Data from research firm Coalition shows why equities may seem attractive  as industry wide bond trading revenue shrank 36 percent from 2010 to 2015  stock trading revenue rose 23 percent  During the first quarter  equities trading revenue fell at big banks but fared much better than bond trading   It s still tough out there   said Richard Johnson  an analyst with research firm Greenwich Associates   Fixed income has been one of those areas that hasn t been doing well  so compared to that  other areas look better   During last decade s bond trading boom  some banks all but abandoned stock trading because margins were so thin  These have only shrunk since then  The average commission in U S  markets is now 2 64 cents per share  down from 3 2 cents in 2007  according to consulting firm Accenture  Bank executives say the only way to make the business work is to trade very large volumes  focus on high margin products  or do all of the above  High margin businesses like derivatives and prime brokerage tend to be riskier and require more capital but are among the few places on Wall Street where profits are rising  Banks are also keen on structuring liquid alternative funds  which hold various securities but trade like stocks  as well as smart beta products  which allow investors to create custom indexes   Banks are looking at ways they can provide creative  differentiated products  that require as little capital as possible  said Greg Berman  a managing director at broker dealer Norfolk Markets who previously led institutional equity structuring at Deutsche Bank AG  NO QUICK FIX Although Wall Street has high hopes for equities trading  it won t be a quick fix for profit problems  Citigroup  for instance  has been investing heavily in equities trading  After reporting a 19 percent revenue decline there in the first quarter  the bank s finance chief John Gerspach  said he won t be able to judge success until early next year  Goldman and Morgan Stanley  which compete for the No  1 spot in equities  were not immune from ups and downs of the business  either  They reported equities trading revenue declines of 23 percent and 9 percent  respectively  European rivals may have to wait even longer to see investments bear fruit  UBS Group AG has focused on equities trading since 2012  when it said it would largely pull out of bond trading  Despite leading in Asia and Europe  it has not yet caught up in the United States  according to Coalition  Deutsche Bank is only beginning to dive more aggressively into stocks  It plans to hire around 100 people to boost the equities trading business  with an emphasis on electronic trading  \n",

restrictive regulations in the technology sector  This in turn disrupted tech s growth trajectory  which for long helped the broader market scale north With the markets going through a rough patch  investing in stocks that provide excellent risk adjusted returns seems judicious Stocks to Face Worst MarchIt has been a rough month for the broader market  The Dow Jones is on the verge to see its worst March after it had tanked 8 97  almost 40 years back  per the WSJ Market Data Group  In fact  the blue chip gauge lost more than 1 400 points over the last five trading sessions  marking the

 the Cboe Volatility Index  soared 57  last week  well above its long term average of 20  This invariably shows that bearish bets continue to outdo their bullish counterparts in the indices so far this month But  what has triggered such a selloff leading to U S  stocks ending in their worst week in years Restrictive Trade Policy  Rising Interest RatesSelling in stocks intensified after the Trump administration announced that it will levy tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports on top of imposing duties on foreign steel and aluminum  In response to Trump s tariffs  Beijing said that it will target 128 U S  products with an import value of  3 billion  These products mostly include U S pork  fresh fruit  dried fruits  steel pipes  modified ethanol  ginseng and wine Such heated trade rhetoric doesn t bode well for the American economy  If a full fledged trade war takes place  the United States might slip into a recession in the near future and the jobless rate might more than double from current levels  Tariffs on the U S  will lead to rise in inflation along with an uptick in import prices  provoking the Fed to hike rates  And we all know that easy monetary policy so far has helped the U S  stock market celebrate its nine year bull run  Investors had piled up on U S  stocks with the notion that quantitative easing will help the domestic economy grow at a better rate than emerging economies like China Fed  by the way  has tightened its monetary policy  At the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Mar 21  Jerome Powell led Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by a quarter percentage point and projected a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020  The vote to lift the benchmark lending rate was a unanimous 8 0  Thus  the broader market might keep falling as long as the Fed continues to remain hawkish The Facebook FiascoAdding to the downbeat tone is a sharp selloff in the technology sector  Investors remained concerned about tighter regulations for large tech companies  Lest we forget  tech shares have gained the most so far this year However  the sector took a beating following the backlash over Facebook s handling of user data

EPS Surprise    Further  revenues of  411 4 million climbed about 2  year over year  up 1  on a cc basis  and also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of nearly  400 million  Results were primarily

revenues at this segment were up 6   The segment s adjusted contribution to profit was  66 3 million that increased 9 8  from last year  This was backed by enhanced revenues  partly negated by increased royalty costs and expenses related to Atypon Publishing  Revenues at the division tumbled 9 4  to  131 3 million  down 8  on cc basis  on account of soft demand as well as market driven reduction in print products in the Education Publishing and STM and Professional Publishing categories  This was somewhat compensated by marked improvements in Test Preparation and Certification  and

Revenues increased 8 5  year over year to  56 5 million  up 9  on a cc basis   boosted by robust performance of Education Services and Assessment  partly countered by a dip in Corporate Learning  The

      "At the top of most successful organizations stands a successful leader  Of course  exactly what it takes to be a successful leader is up for debate \n",
      "Leaders come in all shapes and sizes  and they can have a wide variety of talents and convictions  The one thing they all tend to have in common  however  is an ability to motivate and inspire others around them \n",
      "For businesses  it s typically very beneficial to have a great leader at the helm  Strong leaders in CEO or other executive positions have a unique ability to use their skills to establish corporate policy and companywide attitude from the top down \n",
      "Over the past two decades or so  many great leaders have emerged at the top of some of the world s biggest companies  Of those leaders  perhaps none have been more outspoken and influential as former Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   head Steve Jobs and current Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   CEO Jeff Bezos \n",
      "In many ways  Jobs and Bezos illustrate how leaders come in many different forms  They disagreed on many things in business  Jobs was never afraid to sacrifice cost for style  whereas Bezos has always said to be on the side of making the product as affordable as possible  Under Jobs  Apple was flashy and creative  while much of Amazon s recent success is owed to behind the scenes changes and internal investment \n",
      "Nevertheless  I think we all would have loved to be able to just sit and watch Jobs and Bezos have a drink together  Just watching those two minds interact would be fascinating  and despite the differences in their broad business strategies  they sometimes did seem to have similar takes on life  happiness  and leadership \n",

      "1        Innovators are leaders  \n",
      " \n",

      " Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower     Steve Jobs \n",
      " \n",
      "Although these two quotes are obviously in two different contexts and are being used to illustrate two different points  they both highlight what each thinks about the qualities of a leader  To both men  leaders are people who innovate and blaze their own paths \n",

      " I strongly believe that anyone working in a company that really is like the one described in the NYT would be crazy to stay  I know I would leave such a company  But hopefully  you don t recognize the company described  Hopefully  you re having fun working with a bunch of brilliant teammates  helping invent the future  and laughing along the way    Jeff Bezos \n",
      " \n",
      " Your work is going to fill a large part of your life  and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work  And the only way to do great work is to love what you do  If you haven t found it yet  keep looking  Don t settle  As with all matters of the heart  you ll know when you find it     Steve Jobs \n",
      " \n",
      "These quotes serve to illustrate that both men value the importance of enjoying your work and professional life  Interestingly enough  the Bezos quote comes from his response to a New York Times story that accused Amazon of fostering brutal work conditions  and Jobs was known to clash with many of his employees  Either way  it s clear that both Jobs and Bezos thought about how professional motivation comes from an internal passion \n",

      " \n",
      " If you re going to invent  it means you re going to experiment  and if you re going to experiment  you re going to fail  and if you re going to fail  you have to think long term     Jeff Bezos \n",
      " \n",
      " Sometimes when you innovate  you make mistakes  It is best to admit them quickly  and get on with improving your other innovations     Steve Jobs\n",
      " \n",
      "With these quotes  each man is taking on a classic philosophy about not giving up when you do not succeed  Both Jobs and Bezos were able to recognize that failure is an inevitable part of innovation and it is necessary to accept this failure if you want to be successful in the long term \n",
      " \n",
      "4        I want to change the world  \n",
      " \n",

      " \n",
      " I want to put a ding in the universe     Steve Jobs \n",
      " \n",
      "These might be the most simple of all these quotes  but they probably do the best job of illustrating the overall vision of Jobs and Bezos  These are leaders who wanted to do more than make a big company  These are leaders that wanted and still want to change the world \n",
      " \n",
      "Bottom Line\n",
      "As I mentioned  successful leaders come in just about every shape and size  There is no single quality that defines a great leader  and people can lead with a variety of different convictions  Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos are both examples of great leaders  and that s nearly impossible to argue given their success  While they weren t always in agreement  sometimes Jobs and Bezos taught a similar lesson  and perhaps we can learn a thing or two from their words \n",

      "Investor caution has been reflected in recent sessions by a slip in volume and by our range bound trade  However  last week several significant and potentially positive technical developments did materialize for investors  The Dow Industrials and nearly 30 S P 500 component companies formed a golden cross  which should lead to some continuation in positive price action this week  though I suspect it may be modest and heavily influenced by the FOMC and earnings \n",
      "The principle headwind for markets last week was earnings  particularly for the Nasdaq  Both Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  and Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  reported earnings below consensus  and in the process weighed heavily on the technology sector and the broader Nasdaq index  Last week s price action in both names and in the technology software space  broadly speaking  speaks to cash outflows and a decidedly less optimistic outlook from investors for the near term  This week we will hear from Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and social media icons Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Twitter  NYSE TWTR  and LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  \n",

      "Over the last couple of years  the very mention of the word  apple  first draws up a sleek  white  bitten off reflection of the fruit rather than the red and juicy illustration of it  That s precisely how popular the company Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  has grown to be Planted way back in 1976  Apple has revolutionized the way the world looks at computing  Today  this consumer electronics company is set to alter the face of the healthcare industry with its latest fruit   the Apple Watch   ripe to be plucked Apple s smartwatch  announced in Sep 2014 and made available for pre order on Apr 10  2015  is already anticipated to be seen on more than 2 3 million wrists  once shipping begins on Apr 24  Interestingly  this translates to more sales than that recorded by all Android smartwatch manufacturers in 2014 Until now  the smartwatch was seen as a niche product appealing only to hardcore tech users and calorie counting fitness buffs  However  thanks in large part to the positive reception of the Apple Watch  one can be sure that the company s latest device will make smartwatches mainstream As this technology becomes more commonplace in the world of consumer electronics  it will also make inroads into the medical world  where it has a lot to offer Healthcare Getting SmarterHealthcare  often viewed as an industry that is slow to adopt the latest technology  is actually standing on the threshold of transformative change  Currently valued at  2 9 trillion  the U S  healthcare industry is more concerned than ever about monitoring a patient s health outside the walls of the hospital through intelligently connected devices A number of technology companies are releasing wearable devices that can double as health trackers  From headsets that measure brainwaves to clothes that incorporate sensing devices to smartwatches that allow fitness tracking  personal health monitoring is the wave of the future In the medical world  where pagers and landline phones are still widely used by doctors to coordinate care  an effective wrist based communication tool allows for continuous monitoring of a patient s health  The use of smartwatches in healthcare communication  in particular  has the potential to improve the speed and quality of care delivery While the monitoring of activity  sleep cycles  pulse rate and other physiological parameters has become state of the art in today s smartwatches  the latest devices have a dozen other applications that can not only help people to keep fit  but in extreme cases to stay alive Specific applications designed for select groups like heart patients  diabetic patients and epileptic patients can actually be used by doctors to continuously track the patient s health vitals  flagging clinicians when signs fall below normal  thus allowing them to adjust treatments accordingly and deliver better patient outcomes A Bite into the Apple WatchApple Watch  which pairs with the users  iPhones via Wi Fi or Bluetooth  is being endorsed as a comprehensive health and fitness device  While it allows users to send and receive text messages  speak into the phone to search content and answer calls  health monitoring is actually believed to be a major feature of the watch From collecting data in new ways to helping hospitals reduce costly emergency room visits  the potential of Apple s smartwatch in healthcare is something that cannot be ignored Although reception to smart watches from device makers like Samsung  KS 005930  and Sony  NYSE SNE  has been tepid  healthcare companies are not the ones to dismiss a new offering from Apple as it brings with it a new level of technological power  not to mention brand appeal To tap the power of Apple s latest device  a number of healthcare companies are seen developing and announcing a plethora of medical apps for the Apple Watch platform  We believe that Apple will  in fact  need the support of these app developers  health care companies and medical technology companies to create the functions to give people a reason to want to wear a computer around their wrist all the time By way of this rationale  as the Apple Watch begins to shine on people s wrists  it will throw some spotlight on the healthcare industry as a whole 3 Healthcare Stocks in FocusAs healthcare stands to greatly benefit from the adoption of smartwatches  we feel the time is ripe for investors to enter the arena and ride the approaching wave of growth Several health and health care companies came out to show off their new Apple Watch apps at the 2015 Healthcare Information Management Systems Society  HIMSS  conference held at Chicago this month  While all the apps need to prove their worth in order to reserve a spot on the tiny wrist based screen  we believe that the Apple Watch apps of the following three companies stand a good chance to do so  A favorable Zacks Rank and an impressive Growth Score  for explanation  please see our   lend additional credence to the growth prospects of these companies DexCom Inc   NASDAQ DXCM Developer of continuous glucose monitoring  CGM  systems  DexCom has made its G4 PLATINUM CGM System with Share app available on the Apple Watch Being among the first in the category to be approved by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  DexCom s app will allow diabetic patients to track their blood glucose statistics right from their wrist  The app will also allow them to share this information with caregivers  parents  doctors  or other authorized individuals and send an alert when the glucose levels are beyond the normal range Flaunting a Growth Score of  A   DexCom has seen solid activity on the earnings estimate revision front as well  suggesting that analysts are gaining more confidence on its prospects in both the short and the long term  Over the past 60 days  estimates for the current year have doubled from a penny to 2 cents a share  while for the next year it has improved 9 5  to 46 cents a share Currently  DexCom carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Athenahealth Inc   NASDAQ ATHN One of the leading providers of cloud based services and electronic health records  EHR  for hospitals and clinics  athenahealth introduced a new care coordination and communication Apple Watch app   AthenaText The app is designed to help providers quickly locate and communicate with other members of a patient s care team and support staff  The AthenaText app can sync care coordination activities and information across multiple devices so that the patient record is always up to date  Providers will also be able to refer a patient across town  request a peer consult  or ask for a specialist s recommendation  While the initial version of the app will provide read only capabilities  athenahealth is expected to add interactive capabilities in June Currently  athenahealth sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a Growth Score of  B   Moreover  the firm has also been enjoying positive estimate revisions over the past month which has caused the Zacks Consensus Estimate to climb 4 5  to its current level of 23 cents a share for the current year and 2 2  to its current level of 46 cents per share for fiscal 2016 Cerner Corp  NASDAQ CERN Healthcare information technology company  Cerner  launched its patient engagement app   HealtheLife   on the Apple Watch The app  designed with push notification reminders to track health data and a display dashboard for tracked metrics  will help patients manage their own health  thus building a healthier community  With patients  consent  the data will be sent directly to the Cerner Millennium EHR which will help providers focus on personalized patient care and population health management Cerner s population health management and care coordination offerings are important growth catalysts for the company  We believe that an expansion of such services will enhance the company s visibility  which  in turn  will drive top line growth Moreover  it is worth mentioning that Cerner  holding a Zacks Rank  3 and a Growth Score of  B   has an expected long term earnings growth of 17 3   higher than the industry growth of 16 8  \n",

      "Retiring at age 40 with a  estimated at  185 million  Jeter has had a good run   But as he enters this next stage of his life    and as Yankees fans ponder the end of an era    there are also some long tenured gentlemen nearing retirement from that arena a borough to the south  Wall Street \n",
      "Today  we re going to take a quick look at four legendary investors nearing the end of storied careers   I don t expect any of these gentlemen to retire  per se   In fact  I would expect all to die in the saddle with their boots on  God willing   But when these investing legends do eventually leave for that great boardroom in the sky  they will be missed by generations of investors that learned the trade from watching them operate \n",
      "Warren Buffett\n",
      "Any list of living legends has to start with Warren Buffett   I hope the Oracle of Omaha lives forever  if for no other reason than I appreciate his wit   When asked what his plans were after becoming the world s wealthiest man  his deadpan reply was  to become the oldest  \n",
      "He also once commented that he d retire  About 5 to 10 years after I die  and that he and long time business partner Charlie Munger  take as our hero Methuselah  \n",
      "Congrats  Mr  Buffett   You ve managed to do something that so few of us are able to do  grow old gracefully and with a sense of humor \n",
      "Buffett admitted to CNBC s Becky Quick that buying Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  was the worst trade of his career  yet he s managed to do quite well  all things considered    Buffett has compounded Berkshire Hathaway s book value at an astonishing 17 9  annualized return over the past 30 years  beating the S P 500 by 6 8  per year   Again  that s over a period of 30 years \n",
      "Buffett has dabbled in a little bit of everything over the decades  buying everything from silver bullion to complex options and derivatives   But he is most famous for his philosophy of buying great businesses with competitive  moats  around them selling at fair prices \n",

      "Whitman retired from full time management of the Third Avenue Value Fund in 2012  though he remains active in his company and as opinionated as ever  His letters to investors are as entertaining as they are insightful  if you are a student of finance  I recommend you spend a few days browsing them  see     In his   Whitman digs into the dirty details of GAAP accounting \n",

      "Icahn isn t the warm  grandfatherly type like Warren Buffett   He s kind of a mean old man  to be honest   But he s a hard nosed  no nonsense investor with a reputation for fixing broken companies  He s also a natural contrarian  In his own words   The consensus thinking is generally wrong  If you go with a trend  the momentum always falls apart on you  So I buy companies that are not glamorous and usually out of favor  It is even better if the whole industry is out of favor  \n",
      "Over the past five years  Icahn s flagship hedge fund has outperformed the S P 500 by 8 9  per year \n",
      "In recent years  Icahn has taken very large and high profile positions in Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and was a very loud advocate for Apple s expanded buyback program \n",

      "Irving Kahn has seen it all   At 108 years old  his career predates the Great Depression   In fact  he made his first trade    a short sale of a copper mining company    in the summer of 1929  was just months before the Great Crash   Like Warren Buffett  Kahn studied under Benjamin Graham  the father of value investing as a discipline   He was also one of the first professionals to earn the CFA designation \n",
      "If I am lucky enough to still be alive at 108  I probably won t still be running money   Frankly  it s a stressful job   The fact that Kahn is still actively managing portfolios is testament both to incredible genes and to the emotional detachment he brings to his value investing methodology  Per the Kahn Bother s website \n",
      "\n",
      "Kahn Brothers thinks of a portfolio as an orchard of fruit trees  One cannot expect fruit every year from each species of tree  Investments can and often do have varied and unpredictable timetables to maturity  We believe a suitable time horizon for investment fruit to ripen for harvest can be three to five years or longer  Indeed  a key factor in realizing outstanding performance is having the discipline and patience to maintain time tested principles and not abandon the orchard before the fruit has ripened \n",

      "The numbers are in  Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings per share of  0 55 on revenues of  23 38 billion   This is actually a pretty substantial earnings miss for MSFT the Wall Street consensus was for earnings per share of  0 60 though revenues came in better than the expected  22 99 \n",
      "The main culprit  Fallout from the Nokia  NYSE NOK  acquisition  which has been a mixed bag at best for Microsoft   The Nokia acquisition reduced earnings per share by about 8 cents   Inventory adjustments to its Surface tablet also chopped another 7 cents off of Microsoft earnings per share \n",
      "MSFT stock actually rose in after hours trading  so the Street seems to be taking the news in stride and focusing instead on the positives   Revenues from the Bing search engine were up 40   and Bing now has a U S  market share of about 19    And  the Windows unit which has been hurting for the past several years also showed signs of strength for MSFT  with revenues up 3    This was driven mostly by business spending on new PCs  something that  Wintel  partner Intel  NASDAQ INTC  confirmed in its earnings release earlier this month \n",
      "Microsoft s transitioning of Office from a  shrink wrapped  software suite to a subscription service is also doing well   MSFT added more than a million new Home and Personal subscribers to Office 365 \n",
      "But the biggest news and something that bodes very well for MSFT s future is the smashing success of its cloud business   Per Microsoft   Commercial cloud revenue grew 147  with an annualized run rate that exceeds  4 4 billion  \n",
      " 4 4 billion is still chump change to a company that does  87 billion in annual revenues   But MSFT s success here is critical to CEO Satya Nadella s vision for the company s future as an enterprise and cloud services company \n",
      " Bold ambition  is what Nadella promised to deliver in  to employees earlier this month   And he s off to a good start   Wall Street reacted well to his attempts to make MSFT leaner and meaner  earlier this month  MSFT announced it would be laying off 18 000 workers or fully 14  of its workforce as it reduces overlap with Nokia  whose devices business it acquired  last year   But even outside of Nokia related layoffs  the company will be letting go of about 5 500 workers  or about 5  of its pre Nokia workforce \n",
      "This is Nadella s second major concrete move in his attempts to steer MSFT away from former CEO Steve Ballmer s emphasis on consumer devices   The first  of course  was his decision to make Office available on the iPad a move that strengthens MSFT s position as the dominant maker if office productivity software but weakens its position as a seller of tablets such as the Surface \n",
      "So  what does all of this mean for MSFT stock going forward \n",
      "Nadella appears to be doing a fine job of remaking Microsoft   But his competition hasn t sat idly either  just last week  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and IBM  NYSE IBM  announced plans to join forces on the enterprise front   MSFT stock is priced at a modest premium to AAPL  MSFT trades for 17 times trailing earnings and 16 times forward earnings  compared to 16 and 14  respectively  for Apple  MSFT stock is also up about 20  year to date  implying that the market has already priced in much of the good news \n",
      "Still  I would consider MSFT a solid buy at today s prices   MSFT stock is by no means expensive by the standards of today s market  and I would expect earnings to accelerate in the coming quarter as the legacy PC businesses continue to firm up and as Nadella s growth initiates really start to bear fruit \n",

      "The Electronic Commerce  or e commerce industry is one of the most progressive sectors of the economy  The industry is evolving very rapidly  so data collection and evaluation are particularly difficult  Consequently  one has to rely largely on surveys by both government and private agencies  According to the U S  Census Bureau  the manufacturing sector is relatively more reliant on e commerce  51 9  of their total shipments   followed by merchant wholesalers  26 4  of their total sales   These two segments make up the business to business category  Retailers and service providers generated just 5 2  and 3 1   respectively of their revenues online  with retailers growing faster than service providers  The Bureau categorizes these two segments as business to consumer  All except the services segment grew around 5  over the prior year  Services grew 4    All the above data from the U S  Census Bureau relate to 2012  as published in May 2014   The U S  Commerce Department estimates that ecommerce sales in the country grew 16 9  in 2013 to reach  263 3 billion Retail Total retail e commerce grew 2 8  sequentially and 15 0  year over year to 6 2  of total retail sales in the first quarter of 2014  according to the quarterly retail trade survey by the Census Bureau  Forrester Research estimates that this share will go up to 11  by 2018  comScore data  as compiled in the table below  indicates that this segment recovered very quickly from the economic downturn and continued to grow rapidly over the last few years Key Drivers\n",
      "Since the industry is in evolution  the drivers are changing  For instance  the initial push came from the time savings and convenience of online transactions  To this were added the benefits of comparison shopping and personal recommendations  As technology required for personalized recommendations developed  became more available and its benefits more evident  most e tailers started adding the feature until it is now considered a must have  The adoption of smartphones  tablets and other mobile Internet devices remains the biggest driver of retail ecommerce sales  In fact  trends indicate that consumers prefer mobile browsers when shopping  searching and entertaining themselves  while preferring apps for navigation and acquiring information  Ecommerce sales through mobile actually dropped off slightly to around 10 5  in 2013 from 11  in 2012  as deduced from recent findings by comScore   Earlier  comScore predicted that this share would go up to 26  in 2017  Mobile commerce is likely to benefit from the fact that screen sizes of mobile devices are getting larger  phablets and larger tablets   eMarketer estimates that tablets generated 65  of m commerce sales in 2013  with smartphones accounting for the rest  While both tablets and smartphones are extremely convenient when on the move  tablets have several additional advantages  In fact  they are a boon to the ecommerce industry  since the larger screens offer better visibility of online stores and merchandise  thus facilitating purchases \n",
      "Average spending per user on tablets is therefore 20  higher than on smartphones but since more people have smartphones  their overall share of ecommerce spending is lower  Given the unique advantages of smartphones and tablets  it appears that they are working in conjunction to boost total online retail sales  Additionally  the inherent cost savings and convenience of  showrooming  ensures that the trend will continue    Continued advancements in technology are improving navigation and customer experience on ecommerce sites  which is improving reviews and thus drawing more traffic to the sites  The digital consumption of books  music  video and games all over the world is extending the reach of these goods and thereby boosting sales  Therefore  previously unconnected electronic goods  such as TVs and game consoles are now being modified to enable connectivity  On the other side of the fence  online versions of books  music  video and games that can be downloaded and consumed on a traditional computer or any other connected device are becoming available  Since the shift in consumption patterns is resulting in multi functional electronic gadgets that are no longer optimized for a particular activity  there is a great drive to develop technologies that could improve the quality of each experience Free shipping remains a major lure  However  shipping logistics is a cost that ecommerce companies are required to absorb  So they are doing everything they can to take down costs  Some  like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   are supplementing the  local  feature  customer pickup from nearby store at his her own convenience  with a larger number of more strategically located fulfillment centers \n",

      "Its cash balance actually rose to  3 1 billion from  2 7 billion  and adjusted gross margins rose to 48  from 43  last quarter  Very significantly  last year s announced layoffs and other cost cutting moves are bearing fruit  as operating expenses were down 57  year over year and down 13  from the previous quarter \n",

      "All of that is great news  Now for a dose of reality \n",
      "BlackBerry s improvements were due entirely to cost cutting  and after being cut to the bone  there is not much fat left to trim  BlackBerry s strong cash position was due mostly to assets sales and a tax refund  excluding these  BBRY would have bled  255 million  BlackBerry is also running out of assets to sell  It has  626 million in property  plant and equipment  down from  2 2 billion last year  The value of its patent portfolio  included in its  1 4 billion in intangible assets  may be understated  but it is impossible to say by how much \n",

      "None of this is news  of course  CEO John Chen saw the handwriting on the wall and effectively abandoned the handset business by handing production to Foxconn last year  Chen s vision since assuming the job of CEO has been to transform BlackBerry into an enterprise services and security company  a move I support  I would even go so far as to say that Chen is doing a fantastic job  given the truly awful cards he was dealt  The fact that BlackBerry is still in business at all is a noteworthy accomplishment and testament of Chen s skill as a leader \n",

      "Although retail e commerce is the segment that most of us are interested in  it is in fact just a part of the overall e commerce market  Retailers and service providers generate just 4 7  and 3 0   respectively of their revenues online  a slightly higher percentage than they did in the prior year  The U S  Census Bureau categorizes these two segments as business to consumer  According to the U S  Census Bureau  the manufacturing sector is the largest contributor to e commerce sales  49 3  of their total shipments   followed by merchant wholesalers  24 3  of their total sales   These two segments make up the business to business category  This places the business to business category at 90  of total e commerce sales  with the balance coming from the business to consumer category  The latest numbers from the Bureau suggest that the fastest growing segments were retail and wholesale   All the above data from the U S  Census Bureau relate to 2011  as published in May 2013   The industry is evolving very rapidly  so data collection and evaluation are particularly difficult  Consequently  one has to rely largely on surveys by both government and private agencies  In this section  we will discuss segments of the e commerce market than do not relate directly to the retail of goods  and discuss instead travel  payments  security and advertising Travel The U S  Commerce Department expects international travel to the U S  to continue increasing over the next few years  Visitor volume is currently expected to increase 3 7 4 2  a year from 2013 to 2017 leading to a 26  increase in the number of users by 2018  Visitors from the Caribbean are expected to be the slowest growing  1    The Middle East  Asia and South America are expected to grow 67   60  and 52   respectively  The fastest growth is expected to come from China  229    Saudi Arabia  191    Russian Federation  79    Brazil  66    Argentina  65   and Columbia  54    The Travel and Tourism industry remains one of the country s strongest industries  although the second quarter  latest available data  saw a deceleration in its growth rate  According to the BEA  lower air passenger travel as well as reduced automotive rental and leasing affected the industry during the quarter  As a result  the industry grew 2 5  in the quarter  same as the real GDP growth of 2 5   in the first quarter it grew 7 3  compared to GDP growth of 1 1    The top travel booking sites are Booking com  Expedia com  Hotels com  Priceline com  Kayak com  acquired by Priceline   Travelocity com  Orbitz com and Hotwire

 Occupancy rates grew much more than ADRs most categories  indicating that demand is coming at the cost of prices  Individual occupancy was higher than group occupancy with individual leisure occupancy being stronger than business occupancy  In the second quarter of 2013  total travel occupancy grew 5 3  from last year with ADR growth at 3 5   Group travel is expected to be flattish in the

Google s  GOOG  YouTube is now growing in popularity and is the second in line  according to MMGY Global s 2013 Portrait of American Travelers study  Another report by PhocusWright mentioned that when online penetration of the travel market reached 35  in any country  growth rates were likely to slow down to single digits  The research firm mentioned that only the U S   U K  and Scandinavia had reached this level of penetration and most other markets across Europe  Asia and Latin America would continue to show good growth rates Payment Systems With practically all market research indicating solid growth in e commerce sales over the next few years  online players are vying with each other to come out with convenient and secure payment solutions  There are a host of payment systems in the market  but the greatest progress has been made on near field communication  NFC   quick response  QR  code  Soundwave and Bluetooth low energy  BLE   The latest to enter the fray is Amazon  AMZN  with its  Login and Pay with Amazon  system  Recognizing the most used mobile and computing platforms  the system works on any desktop or tablets smartphones running Android or iOS operating systems  Amazon s payment system is likely to be popular with retailers given its huge customer base  For Amazon  it will also facilitate further data collection and position it strongly versus eBay s  EBAY  Paypal and Google s Digital Wallet  By far the most successful mobile payment system is Paypal  which has come a long way from a mere online payment service  Last year  the company inked a deal with Discover Network  DFS   the fourth largest credit card company  bringing its seven million plus retailers onto the Paypal network  Paypal has also signed up a large number of traditional retailers such as The Home Depot  HD  and Office Depot  OD   The company is now selling its marketing services as a bundled solution to retailers and the success of this strategy is evident in Paypal s growth numbers  The new digital wallet from Google enables in app purchase and mobile payments in addition to PoS purchases and money transfer  Other than the credit and debit card information  users can now store loyalty cards  discount coupons and offers that they can apply during purchase  More importantly  Google has found a way to reduce its dependence on NFC technology  A non NFC enabled phone can now use the Wallet to transfer funds from any of the accounts saved in it  Google now requires app developers for the Android platform to compulsorily use its payment service instead of a competing service from eBay or others  Despite the strong growth in Android devices  Google Play  its app store  has not done that well  partly because of the many steps to conversion that turns customers away  The simplification of the checkout process should help sales on Google Play Apple  AAPL  has removed NFC compatibility from its devices and also introduced iBeacon  which is a BLE technology  The technology tracks the approximate location of a person  the time spent at different stores and even the location within the store  It has the potential to push highly relevant offers and promos at opportune moments  Apple has accumulated a large number of patents for payment processing and it s very likely that that iBeacon will be rolled into its very own iWallet  Payments on its platform are currently handled by its Passbook system  Apple is one of the largest online retailers although it also sells through traditional retail outlets  so a payment platform from Apple may be expected to catch on very fast  The FIS Mobile Wallet from Fidelity National Information Services Inc   FIS  is basically a bar code reader that feeds information related to the purchase into the user s smartphone and uses it as a medium to transfer the information to the cloud  Online purchase of merchandise is also possible  The solution provides good security  since the transaction is carried out entirely in the cloud through the retailer s and banker s applications and personal information is not shared at the time of purchase Visa  V  has also jumped on the bandwagon  claiming that its V me is a digital wallet with a difference  Not only can it be used to make mobile contactless payments  bar code  QR code or NFC   but it can also be used for online checkout  it remembers card details from several providers   Mobile banking is set to grow very strongly over the next few years  according to Juniper Research  The research firm estimates that a billion mobile devices  or 15  of the installed base  will be used for banking transactions by 2017  up from an expected 590 million at the end of this year  Most banks already offer at least one mobile banking offering  with some larger banks offering more than one option  Messaging remains most popular across the world  but apps are likely to remain the preferred channel in most developed markets  Mobile banking has not picked up sufficiently in either the U S  or Canada  due to security related concerns  However  an analysis by Deloitte shows that mobile banking could become the most preferred banking method by 2020  The study estimates that 20 25 million Generation Y consumers will become new banking customers by 2015  A banking com study shows that 48  of  Generation Y   gen Y  consumers are already using online banking services  Moreover  their preference for online banking is so high that around 30  said they would consider switching financial institutions if they did not provide the service  Both online and mobile banking by gen Y consumers largely consists of checking account balances and transferring funds  although they also like to pay bills on the platform  It is believed that high smartphone penetration  higher income within this group and greater digital sophistication will drive increased demand for mobile banking services  Since mobile banking is expected to be the most cost efficient for banks  investment in technology to improve and expand mobile banking services is likely to increase Security With online transactions expected to boom over the next few years  the topmost concern remains security  While banks will spend significantly on secure payment systems  hackers are expected to have a field day  largely targeting the flood of customers going online  Last year saw a huge increase in security breaches  something that may be expected to continue  Recent research from McAfee revealed certain important facts  first  that mobile malware was primarily spreading through apps  second  75  of infected apps came from Google Play  third  the chances of downloading malware or suspicious URLs was 1 in 6  fourth  40  of malware families disrupt the system in more than one way  which is an indication of the increasing sophistication of hackers  and fifth  23  of mobile spyware can result in data loss  What is even more alarming is that even  secure  payment platforms like digital wallets using NFC technology can now be infected by worms within close range of devices   bump and infect    An infected device can give out personal information during the payment process that can be used to steal from the wallet  Mobile security offerings currently come from AirWatch  Apple  Avast  Check Point  Cisco  CSCO   IBM  IBM   Juniper  JNPR   Kaspersky  McAfee  Microsoft  MSFT   MobileIron  Blackberry  BBRY   Symantec  SYMC  and Trend Micro  among others  Alternative payment systems will continue to gain popularity  While some of these payment systems  such as PayPal  have been around for a while  other systems  such as Google s digital wallet  V me and the FIS Mobile Wallet are still in the making  Alternative payment systems never really gained momentum in the past because of the low volume of transactions  However  as online transactions continue to increase  many more such systems could suddenly become more available  We expect mobile security to become a major focus area for technology companies  since this is the stumbling block to payments through the mobile platform  currently just 2  of U S  online spending  Digital Advertising The U S  digital advertising market has seen some very strong growth in the past few years  despite the recession that impacted the entire economy  eMarketer estimates that the market will grow 14 9  in 2013  compared to the 15 0  growth in 2012  Growth rates are expected to continue declining  12 6  in 2014  10 3  in 2015  9 2  in 2016 and 7 1  in 2017  Retail  financial services  consumer packaged goods  CPG  and travel in that order  are expected to drive this growth  The slight upward revision is attributed to previous estimates is driven by strength on the mobile platform  which will grow 95 0  in 2013  53 8  in 2014  41 8  in 2015  33 1  in 2016 and 26 0  in 2017  Spending on mobile ads is expected to increase as a percentage of total spending on digital as well as total media ads in each of the years  The current strength in online advertising is coming primarily from the growing popularity of the display format  Of all the forms of online advertising  display  including video  banner ads  rich media and sponsorships  is expected to see the strongest growth over the next few years  The underlying drivers of growth of the display format are the continued increase in the number of users  greater propensity of users to consume online  a growing inventory of advertisements that serve to lower advertisement prices and the need to create brand awareness online  Google s YouTube leads in the video segment  The increasing propensity to use programmatic buying techniques  automating the inventory buying process  is hurting Yahoo s  YHOO  premium placements  Yahoo is currently focusing on the content side of things in order to boost ad revenue  Facebook  FB  on the other hand has more relevant personal data  which advertisers like  Facebook s main problem is the decline in teen usage and low conversion for advertisers  While digital advertising spend has been moving to non search portals  such as Facebook  search is likely to remain relevant and important  Google is the leader here and is using its other technologies  maps  voice  devices  to make its services more invaluable to users  Its Enhanced Campaigns strategy that seeks to integrate ad campaigns across platforms is also bearing fruit  as it is proving more profitable for advertisers  Search advertising results are measurable  and therefore more predictable  than other media  This also makes the market more resilient in recessionary conditions  since advertisers are more confident about the results of their spending  Since e commerce entails the buying and selling of goods or services over electronic systems  it includes companies that are totally dependent on these sales  those that are gradually moving to it  as well as those that want to use it partially  Therefore  the biggest sellers or the ones growing the strongest are not necessarily those that are solely dependent on the Internet  The following diagrams seek to explain the position of companies primarily dependent on the Internet for the distribution of their goods and services in the context of the Zacks Industry Rank  Two  Retail Wholesale and Computer   Technology  of the 16 broad Zacks sectors are related to the e commerce industry as depicted below   We rank the 264 industries across the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  The outlook for industries positioned at  88 or lower is  Positive   between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and  177 and higher is  Negative   Therefore  Internet Commerce and Internet Services   Delivery being in the 32nd and 95th positions  respectively are in positive territory  with Internet Services  166th position  being neutral  So it is not surprising that the average rank of stocks in the Internet Commerce industry is 2 65  for Internet Services   Delivery  it is 2 94  while for Internet Services it is 3 06   Note  Zacks Rank  1 denotes Strong Buy   2 is Buy   3 means Hold   4 Sell and  5 Strong Sell  Earnings Trends The broader Retail Wholesale sector  of which Internet Commerce is a part  is not expected to do too well in the third quarter  considering the fact that both the estimated revenue and earnings beat ratios are 38 9   The calculated earnings beat ratio based on companies that have reported thus far is just slightly higher at 40 9   Total earnings for the sector are estimated to increase 4 9  in the third quarter on revenue growth of 3 8   indicating escalating costs and sluggish growth  This contrasts with an earnings growth of 9 3  on a revenue base of 6 9  in the preceding quarter  The other companies we are discussing in the e commerce outlook  part 2  fall under the broader Technology sector  Here we estimate a fairly strong earnings beat ratio of 71 2   partially supported by a revenue beat ratio of 57 7   While the estimated revenue beat ratio is consistent with the 57 7  in the previous quarter  the estimated earnings beat ratio is lower than the 75 0  calculated for the second quarter  The earnings beat ratio of companies that have reported thus far is 76 5   better than the estimated numbers  Total earnings in the sector were up 4 0  year over year compared to a 9 6  decline in the second quarter  Total revenues did slightly better  increasing 2 4  from last year  up from 0 6  in the second quarter  Earnings estimates for 2013 and 2014 indicate better growth prospects in both years for Retail Wholesale  Technology is expected to be even stronger OPPORTUNITIES While many of the companies discussed are expected to do well this year  there are a few stand out opportunities  The first is the emerging Chinese travel company Ctrip  CTRP   which is seeing tremendous growth fueled by a growing middle class and increased consumerism in China  the shift from traditional to online media for booking travel and increased mobile usage  These trends are spurring strong growth  which has resulted in rising estimates  The second is Baidu  BIDU   the dominant search engine company of China  Baidu is the Google of China with tremendous opportunities  The company has been investing in the business to build a position in the mobile and video segments and the company is already seeing growing monetization on mobile  While integration of recent acquisitions and investment considerations could be a slight headwind in the next few quarters  the company is clearly moving in the right direction Facebook  FB  is another opportunity worth looking into  The company has seen its ad revenues swell  despite fears of reducing teen engagement and poorer than expected conversion for advertisers  Importantly  the company continues to innovate  frequently enhancing and or making relevant changes to its platform  Therefore  one cant ignore the strong growth numbers and resultant surge in estimates WEAKNESSES We do not see a lot of weakness  although many of the companies may not be great opportunities either  Revenue growth prospects for online travel companies Priceline  Expedia and Orbitz Worldwide are good  International expansion is a key factor driving growth for these companies and collaborative agreements with local players will be the key  Lower value inventories in international markets are on the rise  so margins could be impacted \n",
      "Last week  Apple  AAPL  investors rejoiced in the hope that billionaire investor Icahn s demands would be met while Cisco  CSCO  investors expressed concern that the company was losing market share Apple Shares Say  I Cahn  Activist investor Carl Icahn posted on Twitter that he had put a billion dollars into Apple stock and was pushing the company to authorize an additional  150 billion for share repurchases  Icahn s view is that Apple is significantly undervalued and would trade higher if the repurchase was sanctioned  Apple shares rose after the announcement and continued to rise through the rest of the week  It is true that Apple is trading at a much lower multiple than companies like Google  GOOG  and Facebook  FB   but valuation is usually the way the market views a company  In Apple s case  it appears that the stock is moving from the growth to the value category  or at least that s the way the market views it  Investor delight at the chances of a higher payout further supports this view  It s possible that Apple will introduce some great products that push up its growth rates  But until that happens  investors are unwilling to pay a higher price betting on its growth  They are however eyeing its cash hoard and looking for a share  Cisco s Switch Is Costing The Company Cisco reported a good quarter but provided a disappointing guidance  Management commentary was not unexpected  it continues to do reasonably well in North America despite uneven economic recovery  its performance in Europe is on track with Southern concerns remaining and its performance in Asia is marred by weakness in China  as expected   But shares swooned nonetheless  So what gives  Basically  management announced a massive headcount reduction  4 000 employees  or 5  of the workforce  with no corresponding increase in earnings projections  Management didn t quite explain the delta other than an assurance that resources were being allocated to reposition the company in target areas  likely cloud computing  mobility  security  video  and software and services   Cisco does have quite a bit on its plate at the moment with weak economies  constrained IT budgets  and the continued threat of software defined networking  SDN  eating into its core routing and switching business  Its Cisco ONE initiative is encouraging  but remains a fledgling effort as of now  So while Cisco s transformation into a software and service focused company will not bear fruit for a while yet  it appears that costs will be slashed as necessary in an effort to maintain earnings growth  Microsoft  Partnering With the Enemy  Microsoft  MSFT  lawyer David Howard had a field day pulling down Google  which blocked Microsoft s YouTube app for the Windows phone  again   The earlier app that Microsoft produced didn t allow ads  enabled video download and the viewing of reserved videos  Google s current objections boil down to the HTML 5 coding language  which was part of the terms and conditions  Since neither iPhones nor any of the Android phones are required to use HTML 5  Microsoft published the new app as is  which Google subsequently blocked  The important thing to note here is that all the other phones use Google search as the default  while Microsoft naturally uses Bing  Microsoft is also asking for Google s metasearch data so it can serve the YouTube ads more effectively  One can understand why Google would be hesitant to share such information with its fiercest competitor and only remaining search rival  but it s unlikely that it can prove its innocence in a court of law  That s because this latest move is not helping consumers and not promoting competition  the two things most important to antitrust regulators  Hewlett Packard Company  HPQ  and Analog Devices  ADI  report this week  Read further about these companies going into their earnings announcements in our  Earnings Preview  section \n"
